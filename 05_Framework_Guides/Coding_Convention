Naming Convention
	-1_File Naming Convention
		- All file name should follow pascal casing naming convention
		- First letter of each word should start with Upper Case
		- Example: TestFileName
		- Feature File
		- Page Object File
		- Step Definitions File
		- Unit Script File
		
	-2_Variable Naming Convention
	
		-2.0_Common Variable Naming
			- All variable should follow camel casing naming convention
			- First letter of a variable should start with lower Case
			- Then First letter of each subsequent word should start with Upper Case
			- Variable Data Type should be Prefixed to the Variable name
			- Each variable should start with its datatype as prefix as mentioned below
				- for String = str<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Character = chr<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Integer = int<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Long = lng<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for float = flt<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for double = dbl<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Boolean = bol<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for array = arr<CamelCasingVariableName>
				
		-2.1_Private Variable Naming
			- Pattern: <Modifier> <p_><dataType><CamelCasingVariableName>
			- Example: Privae p_strTestName
				- Private variable should be preceded with Private keyword
				- First 2 characters of the variable name should be p_
				- After that follow rules from 2.0_Common Variable Naming
				
		-2.2_Page Object Variable Naming
			- Pattern: Private <po_><UIElementType><CamelCasingVariableName>
			- Page Object variable access modifer should be always Private
			- First 3 characters of the should be po_
			- After that Each variable should start with its UIElementType as prefix as mentioned below
				- for Textbox = txt<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for TextArea = txtar<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Button = btn<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Listbox = lst<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Combobox = cmb<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for RadioButton = rdbtn<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Checkbox = chk<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Link = lnk<CamelCasingVariableName>
				- for Label = lbl<CamelCasingVariableName>
			- After that follow rules from 1.0_Common Variable Naming
			- Example: Privae po_txtUserName
			
		-2.3_Constants Naming
			- Pattern: Public Const <CONSTTYPE_CONST_NAME>
			- Constant variable access modifer should be always Public
			- Each word in the constant variable will be in Upper Case
			- Each word in the constant variable will be separated by Underscore(_)
			- CONSTTYPE(s)
				- T for Test Constants
				- Q for Query Constants
				- E for Error Constants
			- Example: Public Const T_NEW_CUSTOMER
			
		-2.4_Object Variable Naming
			- Pattern: obj<CamelCasingVariableName>
			- When there is a need to Setting a object By using Set Keyword
			- Example: objFso, objDict
			
	-3_Function/Sub Naming Convention
		- All method name should follow pascal casing naming convention
		- First letter of each word should start with Upper Case
